      <img src="./images/Profile Image.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I have over a decade of experience in the sales, marketing and management industries. 

        Prior to joining American Financial Network (AFN), I held numerous positions in the customer service and sales industries, including Operations Manager for Four Seasons Restoration and Mac Genius at Apple Inc.. Throughout my positions, I have had the opportunity to apply my wealth of sales talent, aptitude for customer service and track record for accomplishing projects on tight timelines.
        
        I am very tech-savvy having Mac hardware certifications and experience with a variety of software, including Microsoft Office, iWork, iLife, Adobe Lightroom and Solidworks (3D CAD Design). 
        
        I strive to maximize my natural given talents to constantly learn, grow and to better myself so that I may successfully reach my goals and inspire others to do the same.</p>
